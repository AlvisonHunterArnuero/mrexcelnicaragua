          I have always wanted to learn Microsoft Excel and found out that most
          people were afraid of either learning or teaching if they already know
          about it. They often tend to mention that it was a difficult tool to
          use and understand, and in some cases, they dare to believe it was
          mostly for code eaters.
        </p>
        <p>
          From that point, I started using this tool, experimenting with its
          options, all of the buttons on the ribbons, the variety of different
          tools on it, and I happened to like it. From that time, I started
          using the Visual Basic editor that comes with Office Suite, and,
          voila, I am now a fan of this and many other Microsoft products!
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to be able to help others learn about this tool, to use it, to
          enjoy working with it. It is now my duty to provide you guys with as
          many tips and tricks as possible to feel that I am being part of a
          change in the concept of sharing knowledge to others without any
          particular interest order than the simple fact of helping people: I
          now become Mister Excel Nicaragua, and I am willing to sacrifice time
          and effort to see others succeed in the learning path of this
          beautiful and very useful tool created by Microsoft Corporation
        </p>
        <p>
          Buckle up, fellows, the adventure is about to begin, Iâ€™m ready to
          start, how about you, pal?
